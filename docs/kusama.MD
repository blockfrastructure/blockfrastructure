# How to run the Kusama Node on our Remote VM

*Always first check the docs to get the latest updates*

https://guide.kusama.network/en/latest/try/validate/


### Code Location
We store the code of polkadot at /Code/polkadot

## Build 
See Kusama docs for build

## Sync Chain
To sync the chain `./target/release/polkadot --pruning=archive --wasm-execution Compiled`

## Become a Validator
Once node is fully synced, stop it using Control-C. At your terminal prompt, you will now start your node in validator mode.

`./target/release/polkadot --validator --name "Blockfrastructure" --pruning=archive --wasm-execution Compiled`


## Configuration
We do everything in the Polkadot JS configuration to manage keys and actions. 


1) Tunnel through the VM to your local
```bash ssh -f -N -L 9944:127.0.0.1:9944 root@NODE_IP```

2) Visit https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/settings

3) Connect to local node and save

At this point you should be able to access the dashboard

### Nginx Config to allow tunnel
```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name NODE_IP;
    #server name should be local ip
    #rewrite server_name ^ > melea.trust;
    #rewrite ^ > my-dns-ip-here.com;
    #
    root /var/www/NODE_IP/html/index.html;
    #rewrite ^ >root /var/www/melea.trust/html/index.html;
    # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP
    index index.html index.htm;
    #
    location / {
        # First attempt to serve request as file, then
        # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
        access_log off;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9944;
    }
}
```


## Terminology

Account Keys control funds

Controller keys
* semi online key controlled by user.
* controller keys hold DOTs to pay for fees - keep the amount small
* exposed to internet - be careful and replace them with new ones
* used for nominating and operation of validator

Stash Key
* Kept in cold wallet
* rarely if ever exposed to internet
* intended to hold lots of funds
* since kept offline it must bond funds to particular controller

Session - more like identify, linking what your validator is doing to your validator
* must be kept online by a validator to perform network operations.
* generated by client
* 4 session keys
