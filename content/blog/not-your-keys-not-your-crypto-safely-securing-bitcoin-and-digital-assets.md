You are new to bitcoin and want to buy some crypto. You head over to an exchange like coinbase or binance and create an account. You create this thing called a wallet which generates and public and a private key and then purchase bitcoin from the exchange. Shortly after you have bitcoin in your wallet - but what does that actually mean? 

## Public Keys and Private Keys

Public and private keys are how users send transactions around on the bitcoin network. Your public key(or wallet address) is where you tell your friends to send your money to. Your private key is what signs the transaction when you are sending money - its basically your password to send money to another user or address. Think of it like a shared post office mailbox - everyone knows your address to send mail to, but only you have the private key to open the box. Therefore, if anyone has access to your private key, they can access everything in your bitcoin wallet. 





Bitcoin runs on this thing called a blockchain. Basically a blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that verifies all the transactions that occur on the network. All transactions are grouped into these things called blocks(hence blockchain) that are created by all computers on the network.
