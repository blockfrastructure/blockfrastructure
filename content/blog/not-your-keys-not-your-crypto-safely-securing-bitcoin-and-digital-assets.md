title: 'Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto - Safely Securing Bitcoin and Digital Assets'
description: Safely Securing Bitcoin and Digital Assets
---
You are new to bitcoin and want to buy some crypto. You head over to an exchange like Coinbase or Binance and create an account. You create this thing called a wallet which generates a public and a private key and then purchase bitcoin from the exchange. Shortly after you have bitcoin in your wallet - but what does that actually mean? 

## Public Keys and Private Keys

Public and private keys are how users send transactions around on the bitcoin network. Your public key(or wallet address) is where you tell your friends to send your money to. Your private key is what signs the transaction when you are sending money - its basically your password to send money to another user or address. Think of it like a shared post office mailbox - everyone knows your address to send mail to, but only you have the private key to open the box. Therefore, if anyone has access to your private key, they can access everything in your bitcoin wallet. To complicate matters, if you keep your bitcoin on an exchange(coinbase) you are at a higher risk to get hacked.

## What happens if you are hacked?

Get hacked - Whaaat? If you store your digital assets on an exchange that gets hacked, you may lose all your funds. There is no middleman gatekeeper (think paypal - which stores your funds between your bank and another party) in the bitcoin network that controls funds and says where they go. In May of 2019 Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world was hacked and [$40 million worth of Bitcoin was stollen] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-08/crypto-exchange-giant-binance-reports-a-hack-of-7-000-bitcoin). In this case, Binance covered the losses, however if it was a smaller exchange or a larger hack they may not have been able to afford the losses to pay back its users. Therefore you should always secure your crypto in cold storage.

## Securing Assets in Cold Storage

Cold storage are physical hardware devices that store digital assets like bitcoin. This is where you should store the larger part of your stash of crypto. It's a hardware wallet that plugs into your computer like a usb stick and can send and receive bitcoin. It's best to store this in a safety deposit box in a bank or a safe where you will not lose it. If this device is lost or stolen - your funds are gone.

## Wrapup

As technology changes the way we trade and invest in a new emerging asset class, we must understand the risks and how to properly safe keep them. Always store your digital assets in a hardware wallet and keep it somewhere safe. The only time you should have assets on the exchange is when you want to trade.
