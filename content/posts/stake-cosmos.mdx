New to staking with Cosmos? Don't worry we created a simple guide to show how to stake ATOMS and start earning returns. 
[Lunie](https://lunie.io/) offers 2 methods to safely stake cosmos with validators. Lunie offers a [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lunie-browser-extension/hbaijkfbhhdhhjdfbpdafkjimohblhgf) as well as nano ledger integration to stake your ATOMS. In this article we will use the browser extension.

First we will need to create a new cosmos address. In order to do that in a secure and safe manner download the browser extension on the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lunie-browser-extension/hbaijkfbhhdhhjdfbpdafkjimohblhgf). Once you have installed the browser extension click the lunie icon in the toolbar and select "Create a new address".

Now we can create a new address! Fill in the details and save your seedphrase somewhere. REMEMBER its crucial
to never lose the seedphrase. This is the only way you can recover your account if you forget your password so its important to store it somewhere safe.
